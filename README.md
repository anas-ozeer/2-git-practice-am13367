[On Being A Senior Engineer](https://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)

I really found this article interesting as it gave me a view into the roles within the software development world and what really matters when in comes to having a long a prosperous career in the field.
The article pulls aside the notion of "how many years you've done something" or "how many languages or frameworks you know" and shifts it towards how one works with his peers, and how impact, responsibility, and growth are the keys to success.
The article provides a deep view on how seniority should be looked upon in the software development world. Especially in the sections where the ideas of mentorship are challenged with sponsorship. The ideas of training the necessary skills is not enough to make another succeed, but helping one become recognized and grow structurally matters a lot for both them and the structure of the overall organization.


## My comments

I completely agree with your take on the article—it’s a refreshing perspective on what “seniority” really means in software engineering. Too often, people equate seniority with years of experience or mastery of tools, but this article highlights that impact, responsibility, and collaboration are far more important.

I especially like the distinction it makes between mentorship and sponsorship. Mentorship teaches skills, but sponsorship actively advocates for someone’s recognition and growth within the organization, which is crucial for both individual and structural success. It reframes senior engineers not just as technical experts but as leaders who elevate others and strengthen the team.

It’s a good reminder that career longevity and influence in tech come from a combination of technical proficiency and the ability to positively shape the people and processes around you.

Thank you for your time!
